~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program will stack individual spectra that meet certain criteria
and have entries in both the flux catalog and photometric catalog.
THIS CODE IS IN DEVELOPMENT.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Review of options called and arguments given to this script:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options:
-> SLC Table:  None
-> Dust Correct:  False
-> Multiple Images:  False
-> Include Stacks:  False

Arguments:
-> Flux Table:  newTable.fits
-> Normalize By:  H-alpha
-> Stacking Method:  weighted-average
-> Stacking Sample Table:  H_alpha_galaxies.fits


The path and current working directory are:  /Users/chrismac/python/stack_spectra
The path with the mask sub-directories is:  /Users/chrismac/python/stack_spectra/LRIS/

The following masks will have any appropriate associated spectra stacked:

A1689_1
M0717_1
M0717_2_new
M0717_3
M1149_1
M1149_2
M1149_3
a1689_3
a1689_4
a1689_6
a1689_z1_1

If you are including in this stacking procedure previously made stacks for multiply-imaged galaxies,
they should be in, and will be pulled from, the directory: /Users/chrismac/python/stack_spectra/mult_img_stacks/
